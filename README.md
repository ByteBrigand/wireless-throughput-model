# wireless-throughput-model

First run "polynomial_bandwidth_snr_wifi.py" to get the polynomial approximation of WiFi data rate given bandwidth and SNR.

Data taken from here : https://wlanprofessionals.com/mcs-table-and-how-to-use-it/

Then you should take the polynomial and put it into "throughput_over_distance.py", set the parameters and run it.
