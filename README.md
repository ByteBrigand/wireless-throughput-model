# wireless-throughput-model

First run "polynomial_bandwidth_snr_wifi.py" to get the polynomial approximation of WiFi data rate given bandwidth and SNR.
Polynomials of degree 2, 5 and 10 are good approximations in my opinion.

Then you should take the polynomial and put it into "throughput_over_distance.py", set the parameters and run it.
